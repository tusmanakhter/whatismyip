# whatismyip

Simple page that displays users IP address and location.

This project was created to get familiar with serverless functions.

The serverless function is hosted on [ZEIT now](https://zeit.co).

The static web page is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) but can also be directly hosted on ZEIT now.
